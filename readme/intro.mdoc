With {mdoc package-name} you can create recursive, modular documents. It has three main feature:

1. It lets you include entire files in other documents.
2. It lets you include snippets of files in other documents.
3. It lets you use externally defined variables throughout your documents.

That's the 'modular' part. The 'recursive' part means that the included documents can themselves include other documents, ad infinitum.

For example, this readme was generated from the various pieces sitting in the ```readme``` directory.
