This is the main file. We can use variables in here:
My name is Eric and my favorite color id blue.

We can include other files like this:

------
This is the file sub1.txt. We can use variables in here too:

My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate!
------

We can also include files that include other files:

------
This is the file sub2.txt. Inside of it, we can include sub1.txt again:

---
This is the file sub1.txt. We can use variables in here too:

My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate!
---

Woah.
------

Last, but certainly not least, we can tag sections of other documents to include.
This is particularly handy for referencing code snippets which might change over time.
For example, here's the definition of MDoc.read(), from mdoc.py:

------
    def read(self):
        with open(self.input_path, 'r') as f:
            self.input = f.read()
------

Pretty cool, huh? Now you don't have to use LaTeX for everything anymore. :)

You can compile this example like this:

python mdoc.py --input main.txt --variables vars.json --output result.txt
