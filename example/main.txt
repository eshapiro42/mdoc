This is the main file. We can use variables in here:
My name is {mdoc name} and my favorite color is {mdoc color}.

We can include other files like this:

------
{mdoc include sub1.txt}
------

We can also include files that include other files:

------
{mdoc include sub2.txt}
------

Last, but certainly not least, we can tag sections of other documents to include.
This is particularly handy for referencing code snippets which might change over time.
For example, here's the definition of MDoc.read(), from mdoc.py:

------
{mdoc include tag read from ../mdoc.py}
------

Pretty cool, huh? Now you don't have to use LaTeX for everything anymore. :)

You can compile this example like this:

python mdoc.py --input main.txt --variables vars.json --output result.txt
