We can include files inside other files. Here's sub1.txt:

{mdoc include sub1.txt}

These files also can be specified via mdoc variables if we want:

{mdoc include {mdoc filename}}

We can also include files which themselves include other files. Here's sub2.txt, which includes sub1.txt:

{mdoc include sub2.txt}

Any files we include can use the variables we pass into mdoc:

{mdoc include sub3.txt}
